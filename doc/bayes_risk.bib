    abstract = {Author summary Mathematical and simulation models may be used to inform policy in the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak by evaluating which control strategies will minimize the impact of the epidemic. In these early stages, significant uncertainty can limit the ability of models to provide accurate predictions, and policymakers do not have the luxury of waiting for data to alleviate this state of uncertainty. For policymakers, however, what is most important is the selection of the optimal control intervention, rather than accuracy of model predictions. We fit an epidemic model to observed, spatially-explicit, infection data at weekly intervals throughout two historical outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, UK in 2001 and Miyazaki, Japan in 2010, and compare forward simulations of the impact of alternative control interventions. These are compared to policy recommendations generated in hindsight using data from the entire outbreak. Our results show that the optimal control policy is identified accurately from an early stage in an outbreak, despite high levels of uncertainty in projections of epidemic size, and that the relative performance of control strategies is strongly mediated by our understanding of the locations of infected farms, rather than improved estimates of transmission parameters.},
